“Test-driven development” refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).

It can be succinctly described by the following set of rules:

write a “single” unit test describing an aspect of the program
run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass
“refactor” the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria
repeat, “accumulating” unit tests over time
